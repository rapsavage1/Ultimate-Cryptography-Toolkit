The Ultimate Cryptography Toolkit (also known as the RAPSAVAGE GODFILE) is a comprehensive cryptographic tool designed to handle encryption, decryption, key analysis, and cryptographic computations. This all-in-one Python-based toolkit integrates multiple cryptographic algorithms and techniques, including Caesar Cipher, RSA, DES, Knapsack Cryptosystem, and Symmetric Encryption.

Whether you need to encrypt/decrypt messages, analyze cryptographic keys, compute modular inverses, or perform advanced cryptographic transformations, this toolkit provides a streamlined, interactive experience. It is perfect for students, cryptography enthusiasts, and cybersecurity professionals who need a reliable way to test, analyze, and work with encryption algorithms.

🔹 Key Features:
✔️ Caesar Cipher – Encrypt and decrypt messages with a shift-based cipher
✔️ Index of Coincidence – Analyze text randomness for cryptanalysis
✔️ Kasiski Analysis – Detect repeating sequences in ciphertext
✔️ Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption – Manage symmetric keys and RSA encryption/decryption
✔️ Knapsack Cryptosystem – Compute hard knapsacks and encrypt/decrypt binary messages
✔️ RSA Cryptosystem – Compute private keys, encrypt, and decrypt messages
✔️ DES Step 1-5 – Perform ASCII-to-hex conversion, initial/expansion permutation, and key scheduling
✔️ Fully Interactive Menu – Navigate and select cryptographic functions effortlessly

🔹 Why Use This Toolkit?
🔑 All-in-One Cryptography Suite – No need for multiple scripts; everything is integrated
🚀 Easy to Use – Step-by-step interactive inputs for all cryptographic operations
🔍 Educational & Practical – Useful for cryptography courses, CTF competitions, and security research
🔐 Supports Modern Encryption Standards – Includes both classical and modern cryptographic methods

This toolkit is a must-have for anyone working with cryptography. Whether you're analyzing text for hidden patterns, encrypting sensitive data, or breaking down complex key transformations, this script provides everything you need in one place.

🔹 Side Notes
The godfile contains evrything. Every other file is their own seperate thing. So if you just need one you can use that without having to use the godfile.
I made this in Visual Studio Code.
This is a work in progress meaning, there will be more to come.
Yes, I will take requests but, there's no guarentee on when or if.
I myself have used this and tested it many times and it works 100% and so far has been 100% correct with its answers....if not, please let me know.

I used Python version: 3.12.6 when I made this (11FEB2025)
