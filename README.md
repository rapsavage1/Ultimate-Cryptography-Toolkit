A comprehensive Python-based cryptography suite for learning, experimenting, and analyzing various encryption algorithms and techniques. This toolkit is perfect for students, educators, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers who want hands-on experience with both classical and modern cryptographic methods.

‚ú® Features

Classical Encryption

Caesar Cipher (CaeserCipher.py)

Vigen√®re Cipher Analysis (e.g., Kasiski.py, IndexOfCoincidence.py)

Multiplicative Cipher (Multiplicative.py)

Knapsack Cipher (knapsack.py)

Modern Encryption

AES Encryption Workflow
Includes modular scripts:
1to2.py, 2to3.py, 3to4.py, State4ToCiphertext.py, AES.py

DES Algorithm (DES.py)

RSA Algorithm (RSA.py)

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (Diffie.py)

Symmetric Key Encryption (Symmetric.py)

Blockchain Basics

Simple blockchain model for educational purposes (Blockchain.py)

Utilities

Key analysis and inverse matrix tools (InverseOfW.py)

All-in-one orchestrator script (GODFILE.py)

Easter egg / obfuscated challenge (elgoog.py)

üìÅ Structure

This project is broken down into modular Python scripts that focus on individual steps or algorithms, making it easy to study and test each component separately. The GODFILE.py script can act as a centralized launcher or menu-based utility.

üîß Usage
Each .py file can be run independently. To use the full toolkit with a guided interface, run:

python GODFILE.py

üß† Educational Purpose

This toolkit was created to help understand the core principles behind cryptographic algorithms by walking through transformations step-by-step. It‚Äôs ideal for:

Cybersecurity students

Cryptography researchers

Developers building secure systems

Hobbyists learning how encryption works
